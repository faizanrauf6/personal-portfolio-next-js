## Overview

Mahir Company is an online marketplace designed to connect skilled and experienced local professionals with customers looking for trusted handyman and home maintenance services. The goal was to build a user-friendly, scalable platform that facilitates quick service bookings, provider discovery, and transparent pricing—all backed by a reliable digital infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Service Provider Marketplace**: Developed a robust platform that allows professionals to create profiles, list services, and receive bookings based on location and service type.
- **Real-Time Booking System**: Enabled customers to schedule services instantly, view technician availability, and track their service request progress.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Focused on responsive layouts and mobile usability to serve customers on the go.
- **Admin and Technician Dashboards**: Built role-based dashboards for efficient service management, technician task tracking, and customer communication.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building a fast, SEO-optimized frontend with server-side rendering.
- **Node.js**: For backend APIs, user management, and handling service logic.
- **MongoDB / PostgreSQL**: For storing structured and semi-structured data including bookings, profiles, and service categories.
- **AWS**: For deploying the application with scalability and security in mind.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast, utility-first UI development.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was managing dynamic service workflows that vary by job type and technician availability. We introduced a flexible schema design and modular components to address variability. Ensuring smooth communication between customers and technicians also required building secure and real-time features with strong role-based access control.

## Outcome

The Mahir Company platform has become a trusted marketplace for home maintenance in its target regions, improving service accessibility and provider trust. It has helped transform the perception of handymen from informal helpers to professional, dependable service providers—empowering local technicians and streamlining customer experiences across mobile and web platforms.
