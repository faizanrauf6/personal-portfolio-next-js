## Overview

Save Energy Systems (SES) DLC is an AI-powered HVAC energy optimization platform focused on maximizing building efficiency while reducing operational costs and emissions. Launched in 2012, SES combines patented technology and real-time analytics to simplify facility management for commercial spaces without compromising comfort.

## Key Features

- **AI-Based HVAC Control**: Utilizes patented dynamic load control algorithms to reduce HVAC energy consumption intelligently without affecting occupant comfort.
- **Cloud-Based Management**: Offers centralized control for multi-site facilities, allowing facility managers to monitor, schedule, and adjust systems in real-time.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Provides actionable insights through intuitive dashboards and detailed energy consumption reports.
- **Retrofit-Friendly**: Designed to work with existing infrastructure, making SES DLC cost-effective and easy to deploy at scale.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: For building a dynamic and responsive front-end dashboard.
- **Node.js**: For backend APIs, real-time communication, and data processing.
- **AI/ML Algorithms**: For predictive control and energy optimization.
- **IoT Sensors and Controllers**: To monitor environmental data and drive intelligent control systems.
- **AWS**: For cloud infrastructure, security, and scalable deployments.

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was ensuring real-time responsiveness between the Vue.js frontend and IoT-connected HVAC systems. Creating a smooth experience across a wide range of building configurations required modular architecture and rigorous testing. The learning reinforced the importance of scalable APIs and seamless UI integration with live data streams.

## Outcome

SES DLC is deployed across thousands of zones nationwide, delivering consistent energy savings of 10–30% per year. It enables businesses to achieve sustainability goals, lower operational costs, and improve overall building comfort and control—proving that smart systems can be both powerful and user-friendly.
